Are you a television junky? But have you ever been bored in a hotel room, unable to find something good to watch on TV?

Does it give you the chills when something that you organized goes off flawlessly? But does it drive you crazy when something goes wrong and threatens to derail your well-laid plans… So crazy that you will stop at nothing to find the cause of the problem and make sure that it’s fixed?

If you answered Yes to one or more of these questions, then you might be just the person we are looking for to be our next project manager. And who are we, you may ask? We are ADB (you can read more about us below), and our vuTyme product is one of the most widely deployed in-room entertainment systems in hotel rooms across the world. We make software and hardware that helps the hospitality industry make sure guests have access to quality video content while away from home. And we need a determined project manager to help us do that.

You will present to management and manage schedules for ADB software development and related customer integration projects, providing routine status reports to clients and management. But more important, you will help grease the wheels of successful project completion by coordinating the efforts of team members, identifying any blockers that might stand in the way, and proactively dealing with any problems that may arise.
